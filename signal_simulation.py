    """
    Imports respiratory data from a CSV generated by the ProtoCentral app: https://github.com/Protocentral/ADS1292rShield_Breakout. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : `string` \n
        Filename of the CSV file to be read
    num_of_breaths : `int` \n
        Number of respiratory cycles to be extracted from the CSV (1 = once in and out)
    plot : `Bool` \n
        Plot the raw data if True, defaults to False.

    Returns
    ----------
    result : `array_like`\n
        Array of size `num_breaths * 375` which holds normalized respiratory data (i.e. y-axis from 0 to 1.)

    Notes
    ----------
    This function is hard-coded to a sample rate of 125Hz and respiratory rate of 20 cycles per minute\n 
    This is the default data our patient monitor outputs.
